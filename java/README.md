### Java Books

#### Joshua Bloch *Effective Java (2001, 2008, 2017)*

A Java classic and **must read**. I of course read all 3 editions.

#### Joshua Bloch & Neil Gafter [*Java Puzzlers (2005)*](http://www.javapuzzlers.com/)

Another classic book by Joshua Bloch, entertaining, enlightening and brain challenging.

#### Brian Goetz [*Java Concurrency in Practice (2006)*](https://jcip.net/)

The classical work on programming low level concurrency on Java using the `java.util.concurrent` constructions introduced in Java 1.5.

#### Li Gong, Gary Ellison og Mary Dageforde *Inside Java 2 Platform Security, 2.ed (2003)*

Everything about Java security polices, *Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)*, *Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)* and *Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS)*

#### Stuart Dabbs Halloway *Component Development for the Java Platform (2002)*

A now old, but very thorough and detailed walk through of the classic Java classloader mechanism, Java serialization and JNI.
